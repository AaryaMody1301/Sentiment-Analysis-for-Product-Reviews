# Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews

A high-performance sentiment analysis tool for product reviews, achieving 92%+ accuracy on datasets with 50,000+ reviews.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Optimized Logistic Regression model achieving 92%+ accuracy on large datasets
- **Scalable Processing**: Efficiently handles CSV files up to 350MB using chunked processing
- **Comprehensive NLP Pipeline**: Text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit-based UI for data exploration, model training, and predictions
- **Memory Efficient**: Smart memory management for large datasets
- **Feature Importance**: Visualization of the most influential words for sentiment prediction
- **Batch Predictions**: Process large sets of reviews in batches

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-product-reviews.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-product-reviews
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- 4GB+ RAM (8GB recommended for datasets with 50,000+ reviews)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage Examples

### Training on a 50,000 Review Dataset

1. Upload or select your CSV file containing 50,000 reviews
2. The application will automatically detect columns and suggest settings
3. Navigate to the "Model Training" page
4. Select "Logistic Regression" as the model
5. Enable "Perform hyperparameter tuning" for optimal accuracy
6. Click "Train Model" and monitor progress

### Making Predictions

1. Navigate to the "Prediction" page
2. Input a review text or upload a CSV file with reviews
3. Click "Predict" to get sentiment predictions and confidence scores

### Batch Prediction for Large Files

1. Navigate to the "Large File Processing" page
2. Upload or select your large CSV file
3. Adjust chunk size and other parameters if needed
4. Click "Process and Train Model"
5. Use "Batch Prediction" to process new files

## Achieving 92% Accuracy

This project achieves 92%+ accuracy through:
- TF-IDF vectorization with bigrams (unigrams + bigrams)
- Logistic Regression with optimized hyperparameters
- Comprehensive text preprocessing with negation handling
- Proper handling of class imbalance

For very large datasets, the system automatically falls back to memory-efficient processing using HashingVectorizer and chunked training.
